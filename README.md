# Laboratory-Activity-3-GROUP

We encountered issue with the TMP36 temperature sensor configuration in our project. 
The initial instruction was to use only the middle and left pins of the TMP36. 
I tried coppying the schematics from this website which uses that (https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-datalogger-with-temperature-sensor-and-photoresistor/)
but when I applied it in the thinkercad, the simulator doesn't detect the temperature and only showed -50 Celsius constant. I don't know sa iba, but the 
configuration I used has the left pin connected to the power source to allow the sensor to function. Without this connection, the sensor cannot produce a voltage output. That's all, thank you.
